@1    = ~Oh, this contraption? This is something new I'm experimenting with. It captures a sonic pulse and-~
@2    = ~None of that gibberish now, girl. You've got the smarts, but it got no place in the battlefield. You may as well be bringing in a cooking ladle to swing at an ogre's behind.~
@3    = ~It may seem a bit unusual to you, but this is how I contribute best.~
@4    = ~You're a smart lass, and a fine one too. Got as good of a heart as my children. But I'll say I'll never get quite comfortable with yer way of doing things.~
@5    = ~Wait, don't the dwarves have runemasters, those who can turn essence into workable magic?~
@6    = ~Aye. Golem crafters too, in the larger halls, and ruins...Pah, I suppose it be more respectable than I give it credit for. Forgive me, maybe I'm set in my ways.~
@7    = ~You are just trying to look out for me. I appreciate it.~
